### Prototype overview feedback
Looks good, you have all the requirements.  
If you can add add points that'd be great.

#### You need 2 design patterns either now or after the winter break.
They'll show up in the assignment 3.

#### Grade for testing: 4
Low coverage etc. This was for assignment 1 testing, not the point we are at now.

### We also need mutation and integration coverage.
Mutation testing should be the easiest since it's just a plugin you install. Free half a point. An example plugin is Striker (Stryker?)  

### Tooling can be improved
Getting JaCoCo to run would improve grade.
