## JavaFX and testing
Try to separate and refactor the classes to completely separate JavaFX and business logic.

--- 
## JaCoCo
Configure JaCoCo somehow to fix it. Magic.  
It has to follow your main source file folder thing.  
>Print the coverage report somewhere somehow in the CI so the TA can see the test coverage at a glance.

## Two deadlines Friday: Diagram assignment and working prototype
> Requirements:
> - Ship
> - Move around
> - Asteroids that move
> - Working authentication

#### Focus first on the diagrams, then refactoring and then the rest.
We don't have to add any extra features for this Friday (06-12) just make sure it works with the features from last Friday.

## UML assignment: 6.5
The use cases had good descriptions but the bubbles did not reflect all the cases.  
E.g. logging in was a bubble but *failing* to log in wasn't.

---

## Requirement engineering: 8.5
Nice, but hard to score perfect so too bad.
