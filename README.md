# Asteroids Game

The first Asteroids game dates back in 1979 and it was developed as an arcade game.
30 years later, a group of TU Delft students reproduced that nostalgic game in a computer edition, coded in Java.

## Installation

### For Developers
Requirements:

- JDK 12
- Gradle

To install:

- Clone the project from the git repos.
- Open the project as a gradle project.
- Open the project folder in the command line or use the command line in your IDE.
- Compile the program by using the command: "gradlew clean install" without quotation marks in the command line.
- Run the program by using the command: "gradlew run" without quotation marks in the command line.

When you open the application there are different choices you can make:
- Log in: if you already have an account
- Register: in case you don't have an account
- Exit: closes the application

### Gameplay and LeaderBoard

After logging in, you will have the chance to start a new gameplay or checking your highscore on the leaderboard.

## Development
The MoSCoW method is a prioritization technique that we employed. It consists in splitting all the potential features in 4 categories: 
- Must Have: requirements that the application can't do without;
- Should Have: requirements that are not strictly necessary as the application can be still delivered without them;
- Could Have: requirements that are desireable to improve user experience or custemer satisfaction; 
- Won't Have: requirements that are not planned for implementation.

Moreover, we adopted a SCRUM metodology to organize our work. This way the development process went smoother as:
- Even from the first Sprint, we had a working version of Asteroids;
- All the code written was constantly tested;
- It was easy to make changes when finding bugs or difficulties.
